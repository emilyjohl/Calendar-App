<h1>Example Calendar App</h1>

Here are some consessions I had to make due to the time crunch but could make this a lot more user friendly

1. Have different calendar layouts for Students depending on different Coaches schedules
2. A separate page for Coaches to easily sort through previous meetings by Student and look through comments and ratings with an ability to edit, delete.
3. Students and Coches be able to cancel and reschedule meetings, but only within a 24 hour notice period.
4. Coaches be able to add repeat availability times without needing to click multiple times - (ex. Every Tuesday 2pm-4pm)

<h2>To start:</h2>
npm run dev <br>
npm start (to start the server and connect to db) <br>
Select a user on top to view events

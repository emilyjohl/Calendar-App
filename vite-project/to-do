To do

- [ ] Create a dropdown at the top that changes the context of who is logged in 
    - [ ] Trigger an api call based on the name and id of the person, and change context of the app
- [ ] Need to connect to db and create a schema
- [ ] Styling - basic to ensure everything is viewable

1. Coaches can add slots of availability to their calendars, always 2 hours long. 
    - [ ] On select make fetch call to save into db
    - [ ] Error handling for not making events in the past
    - [x] Frontend
2. Coaches should see available slots
    - [ ] On load, bring the available slots down from the db
    - [x] Frontend
3. Students can book upcoming available slots for any coach
    - [ ] Change so only available for students
        - [ ] Add error handling like
            - [ ] Double popup to confirm booking and confirm canceling
            - [ ]  can’t cancel before 24 hours, 
            - [ ] can only book twice in one day
    - [ ] Backend call to save when booked
    - [x] Frontend

4. When a slot is booked both student and coach can view each others phone num
    - [ ] Need to attach backend from when it gets pulled and use the to set state and thus send via props
    - [ ] Needs some styling because right now you can’t see the num
    - [x] Frontend and props (phone num sent)

5. After they compete a call the coaches should be able to give a 5 star rating and notes 
    - [ ] Check for if event has passed and no current rating
    - [ ] Click on event and popup shows to add rating
